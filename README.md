# Stock-Market-Crash-Predictor
The **Pre-Alert System for Market Crash** is a project aimed at predicting potential market crashes in the **Capital Market** using data-driven insights and machine learning models. The system leverages the historical data of the **Nifty 50 index** to provide timely predictions and alerts, helping investors make informed decisions. The project incorporates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Science**, and **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze the market trends and potential risk factors leading to market crashes.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the Nifty 50 dataset and apply various data science and machine learning techniques to predict market crashes. The model is trained and tested to provide accurate predictions. Interactive **Power BI** dashboards are also developed to visualize the insights and predictions, making the system actionable for decision-makers.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards
- **Dataset**: Nifty 50 historical data <available on Kaggle>

## Stages of the Project
1. **Data Procurement**: Acquiring the Nifty 50 dataset, which contains historical stock data and various financial indicators.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization, and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to uncover important features that can influence market behavior.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Training and testing various machine learning models (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests) to predict market crashes based on the identified features.
5. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Generating actionable insights and KPIs for market prediction and crash identification.
